# Agentic Supply Chain Control Tower (SCCT)
**Harnessing Generative AI and Agentic AI for Autonomous & Resilient Supply Chain Management**

---

## Introduction: What is Agentic SCCT? Why Does It Matter?
Traditional supply chains struggle to react quickly to constant disruptions, creating a gap between seeing a problem and solving it. The Agentic Supply Chain Control Tower (SCCT) is a new paradigm where a team of autonomous AI agents actively manages the supply chain, enabling it to predict issues, make intelligent decisions, and act on them 24/7 to become more resilient and efficient.

## What is this Repository About?
This repository contains a hands-on, executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that brings the Agentic SCCT framework to life. It uses a simulation of the classic "Beer Distribution Game" to provide a testbed where you can run demonstrations and see how these AI agents collaborate to manage complex supply chain challenges.

## Agentic Workforce: The Team of AI Agents
This project uses a team of 10 specialized AI agents, orchestrated by a central manager agent. Each agent has a specific role and a curated set of tools, allowing them to collaborate effectively to solve complex tasks.

| Agent | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **üìà Demand Forecast Agent** | Forecasts short and long-term demand |
| **üì¶ Inventory Optimization Agent** | Optimizes safety stock and reorder points |
| **üõí Procurement Agent** | Automates supplier selection and purchasing |
| **üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Supplier Evaluation Agent** | Assesses supplier performance and risk |
| **üè≠ Production Scheduling Agent** | Allocates resources and sequences jobs |
| **üöö Logistics Agent** | Plans and re-routes shipments |
| **üë• Customer Behavior Agent** | Analyzes customer data to predict churn |
| **‚ö†Ô∏è Disruption Management Agent** | Monitors risks and triggers contingency plans |
| **‚ôªÔ∏è Sustainability & Compliance Agent** | Ensures alignment with ESG goals |
| **üß† Feedback & Learning Agent** | Aggregates data and adjusts agent behavior |

## How to Setup and Run the PoC Demonstrations
This project uses `pytest` to run the demonstration scripts located in the `/test` directory.

### 1. Configure your Environment
Before running the demonstrations, you need to set up your environment variables for the Large Language Model (LLM) and embedding models.

1.  Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
2.  Open the `.env` file and enter your API keys and other required values.
3.  If you are using a different LLM provider, you may also need to modify the `get_llm()` and `get_embedder()` functions in the `app/utils/llm_utils.py` file.

### 2. Run the Demonstrations
To run a single demonstration and see its full output, use the `pytest` command with the `-v` (verbose) and `-s` (show prints) flags, followed by the path to the test file. For example:
```bash
uv run pytest -v -s test/test_demand_forecast_task.py
```

## Demonstration of Core Agentic Capabilities
This PoC provides tangible proof of the advanced capabilities enabled by the Agentic SCCT framework. The system's intelligence follows a logical "Sense, Act, and Optimize" workflow, with each capability demonstrated by an executable script.

| Capability Demonstrated | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Digital Twin Integrity** | `uv run pytest -v -s test/test_digital_twin.py` |
| **External System Connectivity (MCP)** | `uv run pytest -v -s test/test_mcp_servers.py` |
| **Unified Sensing** | `uv run pytest -v -s test/test_demand_forecast_task.py` |
| **Autonomous Action** | `uv run pytest -v -s test/test_procurement_task.py` |
| **Governed Autonomy** | `uv run pytest -v -s test/test_sustainability_flow.py` |
| **Predictive Foresight (Simulation)** | `uv run pytest -v -s test/test_inventory_ordering_simulation_task.py` |
